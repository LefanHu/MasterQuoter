# Description
Master Quoter is a quote bot made by team "MasterBaiters" designed to save and snip all the best quotes made by your friends. A great addition to any lively discord server.

Work in progress :) (by 2 idiots in high school)

## Current TODO list
- 

## Future plans
- Implement listing quotes for specific people
- Implement game of guessing who said the quotes
- Make a cache, open file globally, save it, don't close it
- Embed colors for bot messages (refer below for resources)

## Note to contributers
Do not use client.run(), ruse bot.run() instead as "bot" is a subclass of "client.
